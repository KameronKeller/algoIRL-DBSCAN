# DBSCAN Script

## Scene 1: Premise

What is DBSCAN?

DBSCAN is a *density based* clustering algorithm. It finds areas in a data set with closely packed observations! 

Like you were probably going to guess... it also identifies areas with a low density of observations, and, isolates this *noise.*

The name kind of gets you there... **density based spatial clustering of applications with noise...**

Let's break that down a little...

1. Given a set of points in some n dimensional space,
2. find points that are closely packed together,
3. and, tag these areas as unique *clusters.*
4. The points that are not tightly packed together are outliers. These points without any close neighbors are considered *noise.*

So... why do we care that we can group together points into clusters?

## Scene 2: Present a problem (Applications of DBSCAN)

Say we want to.. recognize patterns..

Assuming the world is made up of distinct groups of objects that share properties we realize that some objects are more similar to each other than others.

It doesn't matter if we know "what" something is, it just matters that we can group it together with different things based on properties that can be measured.

This concept can be used in:
- Land-use detection
- Determine a berry's **ripeness!**
- Build a **recommender!**
- Identify **fake news!**
- Filter **things!**
- We can basically apply this anywhere patterns of similarity exist!

Our main character Sharon purchases flour from TraderShmoes. The store then sends our protagonist a list of coupons with great recommendations! Sharon is ecstatic!

*scene props:*
- toilet paper
- masks
- and hand sanitizer
*end scene props*

TraderShmoes doesn't know the hero of this story, so how can they recommend things for them to buy?

Luckily TraderShmoes can "measure" what others have purchased and cluster all of those customers together based on their similar interests.

The cluster of products can represent an interest category of specific type of customer, so if one or more items from that cluster are purchased then some sort of conclusion can be made as to what else they might want.

## Scene 3: History/Legacy!

Why is DBSCAN used for these applications?

DBSCAN falls under a family of clustering algorithms.

## Scene 4. How does it work? (explanation)

Ok, so how exactly does DBSCAN work...

Let's think of DBSCAN like finding our neighbors in a neighborhood; or, core points in a cluster.

This algorithm steps through each point in the dataset and labels that point as a 
- **core point,**
- **border point,** or
- **noise point.**

There are two important parameters to determine what we label each point:
- `epsilon` and 
- `minimum_points`.

`epsilon` - defines the space to examine around each point.
- Say you are one point in the dataset. Who are your neighbors? They are the others living within a certain distance of you. So, if you reference one point in the dataset, these are the other points that are close to you. Let `epsilon`, define this shape around that one point.

`minimum_points` - provides us with a threshold from which to determine if a point is a **core point**, **border point**, or **noise point.**
- Considering that we have the shape, `epsilon`, established around us, count all your neighbors within that space. Now, we have a count of neighbors living within a certain space. Compare this count to the input: `minimum number of points`. 

Is the total number of neighbors within `epsilon`.. less than, equal to, or greater than `minimum_points`? and how does that map to the point's label type?

The algorithm labels each point comparing neighbor count to the `minimum_points` parameter.
- A *core point* is a point that has the same amount or more neighbors than the minimum points.
  
- A *noise point* is a point that has less than the minimum threshold aka `minimum_points`: `number of neighbor points` < `minimum_points`.

- A *border point* is a point that has less than the specified number of neighbors within the range, but is a neighbor of a **core point,** and still assigned to a cluster.

### explanation recap

To recap how DBSCAN works... 

There are two primary inputs:
- `epsilon` and,
- `minimum_points`

We step through and label every point in the dataset:

- If the number of points inside `epsilon` are greater than or equal to `minimum_points`, then that point is a **core point** (part of a cluster), 
  
- If the number of points inside `epsilon` is less than `minimum_points` then that point is either a **noise point**, 

- ...or a **border point**, iif it has a **core point** as a neighbor.

## Scene 6. Pseudocode

<!-- write a script talking through the pseudocode, may be best to get a solid version of our pseudocode first and simplify it a little -->

<!-- Here's a web app that might help -->

## Scene 7. Complexity

DBSCAN checks for neighbors within the n dimensional shape around each point in the data. This checking process takes O(n^2).

<!-- detailed analysis / complexity equation? => simplifies down to O(n^2) -->
